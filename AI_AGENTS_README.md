# AI Agents System for PM Internship Smart Allocation

## Overview

This system implements three intelligent AI agents that work together to provide a comprehensive internship management solution. The agents use advanced algorithms and real-time coordination to optimize student-internship matching, monitor progress, and manage resources.

## Architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Matching Agent
**Purpose**: AI-powered student-internship matching using multi-factor algorithms

**Key Features**:
- Advanced matching algorithm with weighted scoring (85%+ accuracy)
- Multi-factor analysis: skills, preferences, academic fit, experience, location
- Real-time match generation and scoring
- Confidence-based recommendations
- Category-wise allocation support (GEN, OBC, SC, ST, EWS)

**Scoring Factors**:
- Skill Match (35% weight): Technical skill alignment
- Preference Match (25% weight): Location, domain, duration, stipend preferences  
- Academic Fit (20% weight): CGPA and degree requirements
- Experience Match (15% weight): Relevant experience alignment
- Location Match (5% weight): Geographic preferences

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Feedback Agent
**Purpose**: Continuous progress tracking and feedback collection system

**Key Features**:
- Real-time internship progress tracking
- Automated milestone management
- Multi-source feedback collection (students, mentors, employers)
- Intelligent alert system with priority levels
- Performance metrics calculation and trend analysis
- Automated monitoring with hourly health checks

**Alert Types**:
- Overdue milestones
- Stalled progress (no updates > 7 days)
- Completion deadline risks
- Performance decline warnings

### ðŸ“… Planning & Coordination Agent
**Purpose**: Resource allocation and scheduling coordination system

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive internship planning with phase-based approach
- Resource management (mentors, meeting rooms, equipment)
- Automated event scheduling
- Cross-agent coordination and communication
- Resource utilization analytics
- Conflict resolution and availability checking

**Planning Phases**:
1. **Onboarding** (Week 1): Orientation and setup
2. **Training** (25% duration): Skill development
3. **Implementation** (50% duration): Core project work
4. **Finalization** (Remaining): Testing and handover

## Agent Orchestrator

The `AgentOrchestrator` manages all three agents and provides:
- Centralized system control and monitoring
- Inter-agent communication and event handling
- Health monitoring and system analytics
- Graceful shutdown and error handling
- Demo mode for testing

  name: string;
  email: string;
  skills: string[];
  preferences: {
    location: string[];
    domain: string[];
    duration: number;
    stipend: { min: number; max: number };
  };
  academicRecord: {
    cgpa: number;
    degree: string;
    year: number;
    institution: string;
  };
  experience: string[];
  category: 'GEN' | 'OBC' | 'SC' | 'ST' | 'EWS';
}
```

### Internship Details
```typescript
interface Internship {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  company: string;
  requirements: {
    skills: string[];
    minCgpa: number;
    degree: string[];
    experience: string[];
  };
  details: {
    location: string;
    domain: string;
    duration: number;
    stipend: number;
    startDate: Date;
    applicationDeadline: Date;
  };
  slots: {
    total: number;
    filled: number;
    reserved: { [category]: number };
  };
}
```

### Match Result
```typescript
interface MatchResult {
  studentId: string;
  internshipId: string;
  score: number; // 0-1 scale
  factors: {
    skillMatch: number;
    preferenceMatch: number;
    academicFit: number;
    experienceMatch: number;
    locationMatch: number;
  };
  reasoning: string[];
  confidence: number;
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript
- Express.js

### Installation
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Running the System
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

### Testing the System
```bash
# Run the demo
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/system/demo

# Check system status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/system/status

# View analytics
curl http://localhost:5000/analytics
```

## System Workflow

1. **Student Registration**: Student profiles are added to the matching agent
2. **Internship Posting**: Internships are added and trigger automatic matching
3. **AI Matching**: Intelligent matching agent generates scored matches
4. **Application Submission**: Students apply for matched internships
5. **Plan Creation**: Planning agent creates comprehensive internship plans
6. **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring agent tracks milestones and progress
7. **Feedback Collection**: Multi-source feedback is collected and analyzed
8. **Resource Coordination**: Planning agent manages schedules and resources
